# Aim: 
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

### AI Tools Required: ChatGPT 


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.


### Prompt Design Stages
 o Simple Prompt

“Add a task to finish my math assignment at 6 PM.”

Output:

“Task added: Finish math assignment at 6 PM.”

  o Intermediate Prompt

“Show all my tasks for the evening and suggest a good time to take a break.”

Output:

“You have two evening tasks: complete math assignment at 6 PM and study science at 8 PM.
Take a short 15-minute break at 7 PM.”

  o Advanced Prompt

“Plan my entire study schedule for tomorrow based on 3 hours of study time and include short breaks.”

Output:

“Here’s your schedule:

9:00–10:00 AM: Revise Math

10:00–10:15 AM: Break

10:15–11:15 AM: Science Reading

11:15–11:30 AM: Break

11:30–12:00 PM: Notes Revision”


### Sample Interaction

Prompt: “Remind me to submit my report by 5 PM today.”

Output: “Task added: Submit report at 5 PM today.”

Prompt: “What are my pending tasks?”

Output: “You have one pending task — submit your report at 5 PM.”

Prompt: “Give me a study tip.”

Output: “Try the Pomodoro method: study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.”
# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
